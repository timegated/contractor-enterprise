# contractor-enterprise
A static template for local contracting businesses

## Overview

Many local contractors and business owners in general choose to go about creating their business' website themselves using WYSIWIG tools due to time constraints. The goal here is to create a ready-made high quality template for people in this position to use so they can avoid the pitfalls of taking the aforementioned route. Ideally this project becomes a plug and play type thing where an owner of a company could take something like this and have someone else or myself customize the look and feel as far as company colors, additional features, or anything else related to customizing an enterprise website. At the moment this is specifically geared towards contractors in the painting industry but in the future this service could be broadened to other industries.

The first iteration of this project will be a simple static site with some basic requirements for what should appear. A contracting company looking to get started with establishing their presence on the web mainly just needs to talk a little about who they are, where they came from, and services they provide. In the future I may turn this into a SSG or SSR type of application that employers can use to track employee time or manage their customer base.
